https://tahirdincerspanishnumbers.netlify.app/

"Numara Ver" generates a number.
"Bu Neydi Åžimdi?" Toggles the state then you can hide/show the number.

This project is only for mobile. Because designed for students so they can check the site out when they are in their "free-time".

Code logic is basic.
There is a number data from 0 to 99. Has two properties which is the number itself. Also the number in Spanish. This is an array of objects.
So number is chosen using Math.random(). Also being set as state when user clicked to "Numara Ver" button.
Toggle number function flips the on/off state. So Spanish Number being displayed depending on this state.
